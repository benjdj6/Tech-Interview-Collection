Technical Interview Collection
========

####Introduction

This repo is for interview questions and coding challenges that contributors
either contributors were either stumped by or "blanked" on during the interview.

####Goals

The goals of this repo are to provide the ability to study difficult or unusual
interview questions and for contributors to be able to reflect on challenging
questions that gave them trouble and to solve them.

####Before Contributing

If you want to contribute a question, please first solve it and test your
solution and include these in your PR. It is also recommended that your code
be well commented or have a well written README, preferably both.
